# ⚽ Football Player Value & Performance Optimization

## 📌 Project Overview

This project develops a data-driven football scouting and player valuation platform for **ZDIP United**, a mid-tier European football club preparing for the summer transfer window.

The objective is to identify undervalued players ("Hidden Gems"), analyze player performance metrics, and predict player market values using Machine Learning techniques.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem

ZDIP United operates with a limited transfer budget and requires a data-driven recruitment strategy to identify high-performing players available below their expected market value.

Traditional scouting methods are expensive and subjective, so this project uses analytics to support transfer decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Identify undervalued players across European leagues.
- Analyze player performance metrics and market value relationships.
- Develop a player market value prediction model.
- Build interactive Power BI dashboards for scouting and recruitment.
- Support transfer decision-making using data analytics.

## 💎 Hidden Gems Identification

Players were classified as **Undervalued** when:

```text
Predicted Market Value > Actual Market Value
```

These players represent potential transfer opportunities for ZDIP United.
